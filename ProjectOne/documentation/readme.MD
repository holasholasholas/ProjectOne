### Description 

---
The card memory game (also known as Concentration) is a simple and fun game that tests your memory and concentration. The goal of the game is to find matching pairs of cards. The player with the most pairs at the end of the game wins.

The card memory game is an excellent way to improve concentration and memory skills while having fun. Enjoy!

### Variations
---
These are some ideas I had thought of to turn a classic into something modern and much more engaging. 

- Drinking/Party game
 
 The concept is to turn it into a drinking/party game, cards would be turned into different forfeits and players would choose an opposing party to consume the punishment. 

- Magic themed

As a fan of Magic: The Gathering or other fantasy trading card game, the idea theme revolves around aquiring pairs of cards to deal damage to your opponents.

Pseudo Code
---

Steps:

1. Create array with players' names (eventListeners and constants)
2. Create card objects, number of cards should co-related to number of players
3. Create array to tabulate players' points
4. Initialize randomized cards across screen
5. Once all cards are flipped, trigger event to show results.
6. Round, option to restart. To reset game state.

### How To Play
---
<br>

Objective:
The goal is to find and match pairs of cards by remembering their positions. The player with the most pairs at the end of the game wins.

If the two cards are a match (same picture, number, or symbol), the player keeps the pair and gets another turn.
If the two cards are not a match, they are turned face down again, and it’s the next player’s turn. <br>

Remembering: As the game progresses, players need to remember the locations of the cards that have been turned over. This is key to finding matches.

Game End: The game continues until all pairs are matched. The player with the most pairs at the end wins.

Example of a Turn:
Player 1 flips over two cards, say a "Orange" and a "Apple". These do not match, so Player 1 turns them back over.
Player 2 then flips over two cards, perhaps a "Watermelon" and a "Watermelon". These match, so Player 2 keeps the pair and gets another turn. <br>

Winning:
The game ends when all pairs are matched.
The player who has the most pairs wins the game.

### Approach to Development

The aim is to keep things simple just to abide to the project deadline.


Additional functions such as creating character's avatars or adding more game resources to spice up the rules will be considered.
