### Description 

---
The card memory game (also known as Concentration) is a simple and fun game that tests your memory and concentration. The goal of the game is to find matching pairs of cards. The player with the most pairs at the end of the game wins.

Single Player: Solo attempt trying to match all the pairs in as few moves as possible. <br>
Multiplayer: Two or more players to match all pairs, player with the most points/pairs win. <br> 

The card memory game is an excellent way to improve concentration and memory skills while having fun. Enjoy!

### Variations
---
These are some ideas I had thought of to turn a classic into something modern and much more engaging. 

- Drinking/Party game
 
 The concept is to turn it into a drinking/party game, cards would be turned into different forfeits and players would choose an opposing party to consume the punishment. 

- Magic themed

As a fan of Magic: The Gathering or other fantasy trading card game, the idea theme revolves around aquiring pairs of cards to deal damage to your opponents.
